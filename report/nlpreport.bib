In such scenarios, current NLP models tend to perform poorly on less frequent classes. Addressing class imbalance in NLP is an active research topic, yet, finding a good approach for a particular task and imbalance scenario is difficult. In this survey, the first overview on class imbalance in deep-learning based NLP, we first discuss various types of controlled and real-world class imbalance. Our survey then covers approaches that have been explicitly proposed for class-imbalanced NLP tasks or, originating in the computer vision community, have been evaluated on them. We organize the methods by whether they are based on sampling, data augmentation, choice of loss function, staged learning, or model design. Finally, we discuss open problems and how to move forward."

To operationalize this question, I propose a simple data augmentation protocol called ``good-enough example extrapolation'' (GE3). GE3 is lightweight and has no hyperparameters. Applied to three text classification datasets for various data imbalance scenarios, GE3 improves performance more than upsampling and other hidden-space data augmentation methods."

They have reached the state of the art in complex legal tasks such as legal research, document synthesis, contract analysis, argument extraction, and legal prediction. In this paper, we proposed four versions of Legal-BERT models pre-trained on the Italian legal domain. They aim to improve NLP applications in the Italian legal context. We have shown that they outperforms the Italian "generalpurpose" BERT in several domain-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition, sentence classification, semantic similarity with Bi-encoders, and document classification.}

The annotation specifies three hierarchical levels of information: the argumentative elements, their types, and their argument schemes. In our experimental evaluation, we address 4 different classification tasks, combining advanced language models and traditional classifiers."

abstract = {Argument structure prediction aims to identify the relations between arguments or between parts of arguments. It is a crucial task in legal argument mining, where it could help identifying motivations behind judgments or even fallacies or inconsistencies. It is also a very challenging task, which is relatively underdeveloped compared to other argument mining tasks, owing to a number of reasons including a low availability of datasets and a high complexity of the reasoning involved. In this work, we address argumentative link prediction in decisions by Court of Justice of the European Union on fiscal state aid. We study how propositions are combined in higher-level structures and how the relations between propositions can be predicted by NLP models. To this end, we present a novel annotation scheme and use it to extend a dataset from literature with an additional annotation layer. We use our new dataset to run an empirical study, where we compare two architectures and explore different combinations of hyperparameters and training regimes. Our results indicate that an ensemble of residual networks yields the best results.},
